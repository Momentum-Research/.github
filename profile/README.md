## 2 Research TODO List

* **A Kind of New Digital Stable Coin Framework** 

  `currency`


* **Similar vulnerability detection of smart contracts based on VectorDB**

  `security`, `AI`

* **Implementation of selective disclosure of Verifiable Credentials**

  `did`, `Crypto`

* **Design and implementation of  Consortium Blockchain framework based on Move**

  `chain`

* **Research and design the L2 solution based on Move Framework**

  `chain`

* **AI-based smart contracts generation in Move language**

  `AI`
  
 * **A decentralized software process of smart contract governed by fully on-chain DAO**
  `Software Engineering`

## 3 Development TODO List

**Implementation content:**

* **AI-based `crates.io`**

Vector Dataset and AI-driven `crates.io` serve as a package management platform for the pan-Move ecosystem.

By introducing AI capabilities into traditional package management platforms, you can talk to smart contract codes, or use smart contract codes on the platform to learn.

* **Move ETF**

A basket of ETFs based on the Move ecosystem, governed through DAO.
